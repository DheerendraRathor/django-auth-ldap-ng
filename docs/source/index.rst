================================
Django Authentication Using LDAP
================================

This is a Django authentication backend that authenticates against an LDAP
service. Configuration can be as simple as a single distinguished name
template, but there are many rich configuration options for working with users,
groups, and permissions.

This version is officially supported on Python >= 2.5, Django >= 1.3, and
python-ldap >= 2.0. It is known to work on earlier versions (especially of
Django) and backwards-compatibility is not broken needlessly, however users of
older dependencies are urged to test their deployments carefully and be wary of
updates.
